<b> Experiment|     <b> Laser beam divergence and spot size

### About the Experiment 
This experiment aims to measure the beam spot size and beam divergence of a laser beam using a detector at varying distances. The laser beam under study exhibits a Gaussian beam profile, which is characteristic of most stable laser outputs. By analyzing the beam diameter at different positions along the propagation axis, students can determine key parameters such as the waist size (w₀) and the divergence angle (θ). These measurements are fundamental in applications involving laser focusing, beam shaping, and optical system design.
